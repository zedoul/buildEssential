This R package is intended for resolving dependency issues over different computers in enterprise level.

For example, imagine a scenario where you want to create a private repository
consists of your package and its dependencies. But, this can be a hard problem
if we hope to manage this over multiple servers with different user group
privilege. They may not be even able to have the Internet connection for some reasons.

This package aims to resolve those issues by easy-to-use APIs.
The name is originated from
[build-essential](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=build-essential) package.

## How to Install

```r
install.packages("devtools", repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')
devtools::install_github("zedoul/buildr")
```

Then you will have R6, XML, buildEsential, crayon, curl, desc, devtools, digest, git2r, httr,
jsonlite, memoise, mime, miniCRAN, openssl, rstudioapi, whisker, withr, and yaml
in your library path. Use .libPaths() command to see your library path.

## Quickstart

You'll need to prepare an empty directory to store miniCRAN data.

```bash
> mkdir -p "~/dir-to-store-miniCRAN"
```

Also, you'll need to have a DESCRIPTION file from any package.
If you have no DESCRIPTION file yet, then feel free to use DESCRIPTION file of `buildr` package.

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/zedoul/buildr.git ~/buildr
> cat ~/buildr/DESCRIPTION | more
Type: Package
Title: Build Essential
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2016-06-14
Authors@R: c(
    person("Kim", "Seonghyun", "", "shyeon.kim@scipi.net", c("aut", "cre"))
    )
```

Then, you are ready to create your own miniCRAN repository.

Use `init_minicran` function to initialise the repository.

```r
library(buildr)
cran_ath = "~/dir-to-store-miniCRAN"
init_minicran(.path)
desc_path = "~/buildr/DESCRIPTION"
setup(desc_path)
```

#Note that they use absolute paths only, not relative paths.
