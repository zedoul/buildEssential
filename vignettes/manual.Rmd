This R package is intended for resolving dependency issues over different computers in enterprise level.

For example, imagine a scenario where you want to create a private repository
consists of your package and its dependencies. But, this can be a hard problem
if we hope to manage this over multiple servers with different user group
privilege. They may not be even able to have the Internet connection for some reasons.

This package aims to resolve those issues by easy-to-use APIs.
The name is originated from
[build-essential](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=build-essential) package.

## How to Install

```r
install.packages("devtools", repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')
devtools::install_github("zedoul/buildr")
```

Then you will have buildr, desc, devtools, miniCRAN, yaml, or some other packages in your library path. Use .libPaths() command to see where your library path is located.

## Quickstart

You'll need to prepare an empty directory to store miniCRAN data.

```bash
> mkdir -p ~/dir-to-store-miniCRAN
```

Also, you'll need to have a DESCRIPTION file from the package that you want to prepare.

Just for quickstart demmo, we will use DESCRIPTION file of `buildr` package in this documentation.

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/zedoul/buildr.git ~/buildr
> cat ~/buildr/DESCRIPTION | more
Type: Package
Title: Build Essential
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2016-06-14
Authors@R: c(
    person("Kim", "Seonghyun", "", "shyeon.kim@scipi.net", c("aut", "cre"))
    )
```

Then, you are ready to create your own miniCRAN repository.

Use `init_minicran` function to initialise the repository and `setup` function to add packages into miniCRAN.
It will take a long time.

```r
library(buildr)

minicran_path <- "~/dir-to-store-miniCRAN"
init_minicran(minicran_path)
desc_path <- "~/buildr/DESCRIPTION"
setup(desc_path, minicran_path)
```

Note that I tested it on OSX only.
